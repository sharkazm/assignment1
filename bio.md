My hobbies include music, golf, basketball and video/computer games.  I'm married, have 1 dog named Utley, and recently became a first time uncle.  I also love to travel.  I've been to the UK, Jamaica, Bermuda, Riviera Maya and have seen most of the United States.  A few years ago I flew to Denver and took an 8,000 mile road trip across the western half of the United States. 
Programming Experience
My programming experience mainly consists of the work I've done in CS 161 and CS 162.  I actually enjoyed CS 162 much more than 161 because the assignments we were given and because I felt like my skills had improved drastically.  I really enjoyed using polymorphism and inheritence to create a battle simulation game.  I've had very basic introductions to programming in the past, but really those two classes have been it for me.  
I've also had a lot of experience with Microsoft Excel.  I actually didn't realize at the time that this was in fact considered programming.  However, I see how the basic skills transfer over to the work I did in 161 and 162.
